                  Use skip-verify if you want to use a self-signed or invalid certificate (server side)
                  or use preferred to use TLS only when advertised by the server. This is similar
                  to skip-verify, but additionally allows a fallback to a connection which is
                  not encrypted. Neither skip-verify nor preferred add any reliable security.
